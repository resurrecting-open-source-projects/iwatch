<!-- IWatch configuration -->
<!-- You can create many difference watch lists, each with it's own contact point -->
<!-- And in this watch list you put all directories and files you want to monitor -->
<!-- The path type decide how a directory is monitored, recursively or as single  -->
<!-- directory. But it will monitor all new created directory (after iwatch       -->
<!-- started) recursively regardless of path type.                                -->
<!-- IWatch will send email alert with guard's email address as sender            -->
<!-- Don't forget to set the correct email address here                           -->
