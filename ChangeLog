iWatch: Realtime filesystem monitor


version 0.0.11 (28. September 2006):
* Changes/fixes:
  - Option -q is removed again because it is not necessary anymore.
  - The monitored directories are now per default not printed out nor in syslog, 
    but it should be enabled with option -v
    
version 0.0.10 (27. September 2006):
* New Features:
  - Add option -q quite mode, no print out in console or syslog for each monitored directory.
* Changes/fixes:
  - Problem in watching root directory "/" is solved.

version 0.0.9 (17. September 2006):
* New Features:
  - Add option -t <filter string> or filter="regex string". It will report only events
    if the file/directory name matchs the filter string. It is useful if you watch a file like
    /etc/passwd or /etc/shadow. Instead watching this single file, just watch the /etc directory
    with filter="passwd|shadow", because if you watch only the passwd/shadow file, the watcher will
    be deleted after one change of this file, and you will not get another notifications. 
    This is caused by the application that changes passwd or shadow (e.g. passwd or chfn), they don't 
    change the files directly, but create a new file and move it to passwd or shadow file, this will
    remove the inode and therefore the watcher.

version 0.0.8 (20. August 2006):
* Security:
  - Now using taint mode ("-T") to improve the security
* Changes/Fixes:
  - Syslog message is disabled per default, but it can be enabled or disabled
    in each watched directory/file. Use syslog="on" in configuration file 
    or option -s to enable the syslog report.
  - In command line mode, the option -w is deprecated. Instead, we can put the directory/file name
    in the argument without option -w (e.g. ./iwatch /bin)
* New:
  - Add time stamp in the output.
