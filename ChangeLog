iWatch: Realtime filesystem monitor

version 0.2.2 (8. November 2009)
* Changes/New Features:
  - Fix the bug where the file being watched contains one of the formats 
    available for substitution (thanks to Hanno Hecker for the patch).
  - Watch the renamed/moved directory properly. In the previous version, 
    after a directory was moved/renamed, iwatch used the old name if 
    an event occurs.
  - Fix unnecessary watching of create event. In the previous version,
    create event was watched although it is not specified.  
  - Add a functionality to specify the charset in command line mode 
    (using option -C charset) and in daemon mode (as attribute in config tag)
  - Add a functionality to reload the configuration file using the SIGHUP signal.

version 0.2.1 (12. March 2007)
* Changes/New Features:
  - Option -X was added. It is exception with regex string.
  - New string format in command option:
      %c Event cookie number.
      %e Event name.
      %F The old filename in case moved_to event.
  - Fix the problem with email, it send now email for all defined events.

version 0.2.0 (25. January 2007):
* Changes/New Features:
  - It validates now the xml file using iwatch.dtd file.
  - Dependency was changed from XML::Simple to XML::SimpleObject::LibXML,
    this is necessary for XML validation using DTD file.
  - This is a test version due of change from XML::Simple to XML::SimpleObject::LibXML.

version 0.1.0 (14. January 2007):
* Changes/fixes:
  - Because it's already stable and there is no major problem
    since few months, we move from alpha status to beta.
  - Give a warning if it can't watch the file/directory.
  - Update the documentation with information about DTD.
    Thanks to Oliver Frommel for the bug report and suggestion to use DTD
    for the validation of xml configuration file. It will be implemented in 
    the next release.

version 0.0.12 (2. November 2006):
* New Features:
  - Options --help, --version are now supported, thanks to Michael Prokop <mika@grml.org> for this suggestion 
    and his supports to this project.
  - It supports pid file by default at /var/run/iwatch.pid, and can be changed with
    option -p. Thanks to Alexander 'formorer' Wirt for this patch and also his supports to this 
    project.

version 0.0.11 (28. September 2006):
* Changes/fixes:
  - Option -q is removed again because it is not necessary anymore.
  - The List of monitored directories is now per default neither printed out nor in syslog, 
    but it could be enabled with option -v
    
version 0.0.10 (27. September 2006):
* New Features:
  - Add option -q quite mode, no print out in console or syslog for each monitored directory.
* Changes/fixes:
  - Problem in watching root directory "/" is solved.

version 0.0.9 (17. September 2006):
* New Features:
  - Add option -t <filter string> or filter="regex string". It will report only events
    if the file/directory name matchs the filter string. It is useful if you watch a file like
    /etc/passwd or /etc/shadow. Instead watching this single file, just watch the /etc directory
    with filter="passwd|shadow", because if you watch only the passwd/shadow file, the watcher will
    be deleted after one change of this file, and you will not get another notifications. 
    This is caused by the application that changes passwd or shadow (e.g. passwd or chfn), they don't 
    change the files directly, but create a new file and move it to passwd or shadow file, this will
    remove the inode and therefore the watcher.

version 0.0.8 (20. August 2006):
* Security:
  - Now using taint mode ("-T") to improve the security
* Changes/Fixes:
  - Syslog message is disabled per default, but it can be enabled or disabled
    in each watched directory/file. Use syslog="on" in configuration file 
    or option -s to enable the syslog report.
  - In command line mode, the option -w is deprecated. Instead, we can put the directory/file name
    in the argument without option -w (e.g. ./iwatch /bin)
* New:
  - Add time stamp in the output.
